# Olivia Projects

## Setup

Install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/).

**Try without these, but install them if you get errors:**
```
npm install vega
npm install vega-lite
npm install vega-embed
```

## Running the Project

I have added a few npm scripts to help you get started:
  • To build your project run:  npm run build
  • To start your project locally run:  npm start
